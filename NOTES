#To plot aligned stuff
#Get extended/reference scale
alignObj<-readAlign(filename)
refScale<-alignObj[[1]]
refSeq<-alignObj[[2]]


#The user trsform datas prior to the track construction and use extended coordinates in plotTracks
ProbeTrack needs a sequence with inserted gaps and converted positions
DTrack needs converted positions
ATrack needs HivFeatures retrieved using the refScale in loadFeature()

#For a new alignment
#Convert the db using the alignment file
ndb<-convertDB(pep_hxb2,alignFile)


#makeDB and insertGaps are probably obsolete because of convertDB
#The Axis tracks plots weird when there is no DTrack/ATrack and to= is not specified
# -> it's consistent with Gviz's behaviour
#    however I may need to change that if we want to plot only PATrack/SeqTrack/ProbeTrack (which is still stupid because unless the sequence is really small, SeqTrack and ProbeTrack information won't be readable)
#Warnings on DB load
